What you'll find here is some of my personal Pick Basic source code (and maybe some necessary data, too).

Projects
* [AnyKey](AnyKey) - enable Pick programs to respond to any key (or combination of keys) on the keyboard, no matter what terminal emulation or terminal emulator is being used.
* [PreCompiler](PreCompiler) - allows portable code by intelligently selecting blocks of code based on Database flavour
